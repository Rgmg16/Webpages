                <li><h2><u>Believe what the word says</u></h2></li>
                <p>There’s no point in reading the Bible if you don’t plan to also believe it. When you read, make an effort to believe what it says. Sometimes it won’t make sense. Sometimes it’ll contradict what you previously believed. Sometimes you’ll doubt. This is where you have the privilege of asking the Holy Spirit for help. He will open your eyes and help you to genuinely believe the words you are reading.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Remember key truths from scripture</u></h2></li>
                <p>You can apply the Bible to your life by remembering key truths. Remember promises, principles, commandments, and prayers. Don’t just read it, take it to heart and listen for what God might be saying to you through it. </p>

                <li><h2><u>Allow scripture to expose sin </u></h2></li>
                <p>Let God’s word reveal sin in your life and then confess it and ask him to help you. God’s word also purifies our hearts and leads us into sanctification. If the word is speaking to you, take it to heart. </p>

                <li><h2><u>Pray about what you’ve read</u></h2></li>
                <p>Don’t just read it, pray about it. Thank God for his word and pray that he would help you to live it out. You can also specifically pray using the words from the passage. This is known as praying scripture. </p>
                
                <li><h2><u>Align your life with what the Bible says</u></h2></li>
                <p>Finally, apply scripture by aligning your life with what it says. Sometimes we read the Bible and notice that it contradicts our lifestyle. Something needs to change. Well, the Bible is infallible. So it’s us that needs to be changed. Again, the Holy Spirit helps us with this. As the word convicts us of our sin and shortcomings, the Holy Spirit helps to transform us. But, we have to allow the Holy Spirit in so that he can do the work of changing us. </p>
