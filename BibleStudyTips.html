                <li><h2><u>Spend Time in God’s Word</u></h2></li>
                <p>In order to effectively study the Bible, we have to spend time in it. We will not be able to learn and grasp much from God’s Word if we are not reading it regularly. Spending time in the Bible will increase our familiarity with it. It will also allow us to see themes that are present in different books of the Bible and find applications in passages.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Look for Context in Passages</u></h2></li>
                <p>Perhaps, some of us have seen Bible verses taken completely out of context on social media posts or on cute decor. When we study the Bible, we should look at the context. Reading the Bible is about more than pulling out a singular verse here and there without any thought. We must pay attention to the whole picture in order to grasp the meaning of a verse or passage.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Seek Guidance</u></h2></li>
                <p>When it comes to studying the Bible, seeking guidance can be a huge benefit. Other people may have more knowledge or insight that we did not catch onto in our own studies. Going to someone with wisdom, such as a pastor or professor, can help us to have deeper and more mature understanding of what we are studying.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Study With Other People</u></h2></li>
                <p>For some of us, it may be hard to stick to the habit of studying the Bible if we read it by ourselves. However, if we study with someone else or in a group, we can have accountability when it comes to reading the Bible. We also may gain different interpretations or perceptions of the scripture that we did not find when reading it for ourselves.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Explore Resource and Tools for Studying the Bible</u></h2></li>
                <p>Today, there are lots of study tools that can help us study the Bible. There are online resources, Bible translations, commentaries, videos and so much more that can help us dive into God’s Word. Using the resources and tools for studying the Bible can deepen our understanding of the Bible and even help us to grow closer to God as we learn more about him. We just have to be aware of where we are getting these resources and careful to make sure that they are reliable.</p>
