                <li><h2><u>Discerning the Voice of God Though Bible Study</u></h2></li>
                <p>Thanks to the Ten Commandments, one knows that a voice, which urges one to start an affair with a married coworker is not the voice of God. But what if that is an emotional affair? We can argue that the Ten Commandments do not speak specifically to this question, but again we would know one’s personal voice from God’s voice because Christ taught that our thoughts matter.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Discerning the Voice of God through Our Pastors</u></h2></li>
                <p>Speaking to the Christian’s individual needs in the moment was not the purpose for which Scripture was written, but many times the pastor will hear “I felt as though you were speaking directly to me.” If one’s local pastor is an obedient servant of Christ who preaches the gospel weekly, any inner voice urging one to avoid his sermons is unlikely to have come from the Lord.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Godly Wisdom Through Other Believers</u></h2></li>
                <p>The speaker, as part of a body of believers, would also hear that truth. While non-Christians can still impart wisdom, Western culture generally promotes self-reliance. If one wants to hear godly wisdom, this needs to come from people who are maturing in Christ; people who desire to obey God.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Hearing God Through Regular Prayer</u></h2></li>
                <p>We pray in order to worship and praise the Lord; to come into his presence by the power of the Holy Spirit given us by the Risen Christ. Yet, the Lord in his mercy can and does speak to us through our prayers in words we hear as though from God.

                    They might pop into one’s mind as a voice or a picture. How does one know this comes from God and not from a sinful longing? We must trust the Spirit. “In everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7).
                    
                    That peace comes from the Holy Spirit, and we recognize the Spirit’s voice when we ask God to inform the desires of our heart (Psalm 37:4). Start there, praying for God’s will rather than our own. Follow the Lord’s prayer through praise, thanks, and confession before asking for anything.</p>

                <li><h2><u>You Will Know</u></h2></li>
                <p>God’s voice will be recognizable if we apply all the steps above. Confusion could be a mask for denial if the Lord’s voice is saying something, which is tough to hear. If one nurtures a regular relationship with God through prayer, study, and fellowship, one starts to recognize the Father’s voice. “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27).</p>
