                <li><h2><u>Accept your need to pray</u></h2></li>
                <p>Consider how much Jesus depended on prayer. Jesus prayed not only to set an example but also to teach us that even the Son of God needed to be connected through prayer to God. It was obvious that unless He had spent time with the Father, He could not be effective in ministry.</p>
                
                <li><h2><u>Admit your need to learn</u></h2></li>
                <p>Even the apostles asked Jesus to teach them to pray (Luke 11). Prayer is not a formula or a code, but one heart talking to another, expressing our sincere desire to know the heart of God. One of the best ways to learn is just to do it. T. W. Hunt's In God's Presence is one of the best books to help you get into the practice of praying.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Align yourself with God</u></h2></li>
                <p>Jesus never prayed, "If this is Your will, Father." He knew God's will because He prayed and listened to Him. God lets us know His will when we spend time with Him, whether through prayer, Bible study, worship, or conversation with others who also seek God's will. Prayer is listening as well as speaking, feeling as well as pleading.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Attune to others' needs</u></h2></li>
                <p>The much-maligned political phrase, "I feel your pain" has signiÔ¨Åcance for a Christian. Anytime we feel the pain of another person, our immediate response should be that God has revealed a prayer opportunity. Hearing, feeling, sensing, and seeking the needs of others reflects God's work in and through us. Ask God to help you see others' needs as He sees them and to quicken your heart to stop and pray.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Adapt to focus on God</u></h2></li>
                <p>The difference between you and God's greatest prayer warriors is your time and focus. God has given all of us the same amount of time and the same instruction: Seek Him and invest ourselves in prayer for others. Whether we do this or not depends on our willingness and desire.</p>
