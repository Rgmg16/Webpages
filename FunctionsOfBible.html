                <li><h2><u>Absolute law</u></h2></li>
                <p>As the Bible is classed as the Word of God, some of the teachings within it are classed as 
                    absolute law
                    . An absolute law is one that must be followed at all times, such as the 
                    Ten Commandments
                    . Because these are laws set down by God, then they must be obeyed.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Guidance</u></h2></li>
                <p>The Bible is used by Christians to give them guidance about how they can live their their lives in the way God would want them to. There is guidance in the Bible on many areas of life and Christians will turn to this advice when they are faced with a dilemma.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Worship</u></h2></li>
                <p>Another main use of the Bible is for it to be read during worship services and ceremonies. Passages from the Bible are read and discussed during regular worship services where the priest will read a certain passage of the Bible, this passage will often have some meaning, for example if there has been a disaster in the world the priest may choose to read a passage about a Christian's duty to help and pray for others.</p>

                <li><h2><u>Ceremonies</u></h2></li>
                <p>The Bible plays a key role during 
                    rites of passage
                     and ceremonies. In each ceremony there will be readings from the Bible. The scripture passages chosen will link the ceremonies to the life and teaching of Christ. Here are some examples.</p>

                <li><h2><u>It testifies concerning Christ</u></h2></li>
                <p>The first function of the Word of God is that it testifies concerning Jesus Christ. We may think that the Scriptures mainly testify of many acts or things concerning God in a general way, or that they tell us how we should live. But here, the Lord Jesus said that the Scriptures testify concerning Him. The Scriptures reveal so many aspects of the wonderful person of Christ. </p>
